let counter = 120; // counter is a number
console.log(typeof(counter)); // "number"

counter = false;   // counter is now a boolean
console.log(typeof(counter)); // "boolean"

counter = "Hi";   // counter is now a string
console.log(typeof(counter)); // "string"
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

Output:

"number"
"boolean"
"string"
example
<script type="text/javascript" >
let counter=20;
alert("counter = " + counter);
alert(typeof(counter));
counter=true;
alert("counter = " + counter);
alert(typeof(counter));
counter="mkpits";
alert("counter = " + counter);
alert(typeof(counter));

Code language: JSON / JSON with Comments (json)

The undefined type

The undefined type is a primitive type that has one value undefined.

By default, when a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned the value undefined.

Consider the following example:
<script type="text/javascript" >
let counter;
alert("counter = " + counter);
alert(typeof(counter));



</script>

<body>
<h1>mkpits solution</h1>



</body>



In this example, the counter is a variable. Since counter hasn’t been initialized, it is assigned the value undefined. The type of counter is also undefined.

It’s important to note that the  typeof operator also returns undefined when you call it on a variable that hasn’t been declared:

console.log(typeof undeclaredVar); // undefined
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

The null type

The null type is the second primitive data type that also has only one value: null. 

Javascript defines that null is an empty object pointer. See the following example:
<script type="text/javascript" >
let counter=null;
alert("counter = " + counter);
alert(typeof(counter));



</script>

<body>
<h1>mkpits solution</h1>



</body>



It is a good practice to assign a variable that later holds an object to null so that you can check whether the object is null or not by using the if statement as follows:

<script type="text/javascript" >
let counter=null;
if(counter != null)
alert("counter = " + counter);
else
alert("counter is null");



</script>

<body>
<h1>mkpits solution</h1>



</body>


JavaScript defines that null is equal to undefined as shown in the following statement.

console.log(null == undefined); // true
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

The number type

JavaScript uses the IEEE-754 format to represent both integer and floating-point numbers.
Integer numbers

The following statement declares a variable that holds an integer.

<script type="text/javascript" >
let num = 100;
alert("num = " + num);




</script>

<body>
<h1>mkpits solution</h1>



</body>


If you want to represent the octal (base 8) literals, you put the first digit as zero (0) followed by octal digit numbers (0 to 7) as follows:

let oct = 060; // octal for 48
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

If the literal of an octal number is out of the range, JavaScript treats it as a decimal as shown in the following example.

let d = 090; // intepreted as 90
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

To avoid confusion, ES6 allows you to specify an octal literal by using the prefix 0o followed by a sequence of octal digits from 0 through 7:

let v = 0o45;
console.log(v); // 37
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

To create hexadecimal (base 16) literals, you use 0x (in lowercase) as the first two characters followed by any number of hexadecimal digits (0 to 9, and A to F).

let h = 0xf; // same as 0xF hexadecimal for 15
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

Floating-point numbers

To represent a floating-point number, you include a decimal point followed by at least one number. For example:

<script type="text/javascript" >
let num = 100.2;
alert("num = " + num);




</script>
