The NaN has two special characteristics:

    Any operation with NaN returns NaN.
    The NaN does not equal any value, including itself.

Here are some examples:

console.log(NaN/2); // NaN
console.log(NaN == NaN); // false
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

The string type

In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of zero or more characters. A literal string begins and ends with either a single quote(‘) or a double quote (“).

A string that starts with a double quote must end with a double quote and a string that begins with a single quote must end with a single quote.

Here are some examples:

let greeting = 'Hi';
let s = "It's a valid string";
let str = 'I\'m also a string'; // use \ to escape the single quote (')
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
<script type="text/javascript" >
let greeting = 'Hi';
let s = "It's a valid string";
let str = 'I\'m also a string'; // use \ to escape the single quote (')

alert (greeting);
alert (s);
alert (str);

JavaScript strings are immutable. It means that you cannot modify a string once it is created.

However, you can create a new string based on an operation on the original string, like this:

let str = 'JavaScript';
str = str + ' String';
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

In this example:

    First, declare the str variable and initialize it to a string of 'JavaScript'.
    Second, use the + operator to combine 'JavaScript' with ' String' to make its value as 'Javascript String'.

Behind the scene, the JavaScript engine creates a new string that holds the new string 'JavaScript String' and destroys two other original strings 'JavaScript' and ' String'.
The boolean type

The boolean type has two values: true and false, in lowercase.

The following example declares two variables that hold boolean values.

<script type="text/javascript" >
let inProgress = true;
let completed = false;
alert(inProgress);
alert(completed);

JavaScript allows values of other types to be converted into boolean values of true or false.

To convert a value of another data type into a boolean value, you use the Boolean function. The following table shows the conversion rules:
Type		true					false
string		non-empty string			empty string
number	non-zero number and Infinity		0, NaN
object		non-null 				object	null
undefined	 	undefined

See the following demonstration:
<script type="text/javascript" >
let name="amit";
alert(Boolean(name));

let name1='';
alert(Boolean(name1));


</script>
