JavaScript has six primitive data types:

    null
    undefined
    boolean
    number
    string
    symbol – available only from ES6

and one complex data type called object.

JavaScript is a dynamic language or loosely typed therefore a variable doesn’t associate with any type. However, its value does.

In other words, the same variable can hold values of different types at any time. For example:

let counter = 120; // counter is a number
counter = false;   // counter is now a boolean
counter = "foo";   // counter is now a string
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
example
<script type="text/javascript" >
let counter=20;
alert("counter = " + counter);
counter=true;
alert("counter = " + counter);
counter="mkpits";
alert("counter = " + counter);


</script>

<body>
<h1>mkpits solution</h1>
